# FlowTrack
A Python-based traffic monitoring system using YOLO object detection on RTSP streams from Unifi IP cameras to count vehicles, estimate speed, and analyze traffic patterns. Future updates will include vehicle type, color detection, and pedestrian counting.


### **Project Timeline and Steps**

#### **Week 1-2: Planning and Setup**
1. **Define Requirements**: 
   - Decide on the key metrics you want to start with (e.g., car count, speed).
   - Outline additional future features (vehicle type, color, pedestrians).
   - Determine the necessary hardware and software (e.g., a computer with GPU support for YOLO).

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Install Python and required libraries (`opencv-python`, `ffmpeg-python`, `numpy`, etc.).
   - Install a deep learning framework (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) and the YOLO model of your choice (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, etc.).
   - Set up RTSP stream access from your Unifi IP cameras.

3. **Test RTSP Stream**:
   - Write a Python script to access and display the RTSP stream from one of your cameras to ensure you have the proper connection.

#### **Week 3-4: Basic Car Detection and Counting**
4. **Integrate YOLO Model**:
   - Download pre-trained YOLO weights suitable for vehicle detection.
   - Write a script to read the video stream frame-by-frame and run inference using the YOLO model to detect cars.

5. **Implement Basic Counting Logic**:
   - Develop logic to count cars passing a certain point or region in the camera frame.
   - Use a combination of object tracking algorithms (e.g., Deep SORT) to avoid double counting.

6. **Data Logging**:
   - Set up a simple logging mechanism (CSV, SQLite) to store the number of cars per day.

#### **Week 5-6: Optimization and Deployment**
7. **Optimize the Model and Pipeline**:
   - Experiment with different YOLO models (YOLOv5, YOLOv7) for accuracy and speed.
   - Optimize your pipeline for real-time performance (consider hardware acceleration like CUDA if using NVIDIA GPUs).

8. **Deploy the Initial Version**:
   - Run the script on a dedicated computer or server.
   - Monitor the performance and make adjustments as needed (e.g., handling false positives/negatives).

#### **Week 7-8: Adding Additional Features**
9. **Enhance Detection Capabilities**:
   - Add functionality to detect vehicle types (car, truck, motorcycle) and colors.
   - Implement algorithms for speed estimation (using frame rate and known distances).

10. **Integrate Pedestrian Detection**:
    - Expand the model to detect pedestrians and add a new metric for counting them.

11. **Visualize Data**:
    - Create a dashboard or simple visualization to display daily traffic metrics.

#### **Week 9+: Testing and Iteration**
12. **Testing and Calibration**:
    - Test the model over different days and weather conditions to ensure reliability.
    - Fine-tune the model or detection parameters based on real-world results.

13. **Document and Automate**:
    - Write documentation on how to run and maintain the project.
    - Set up automation for starting the script and data backups.

#### **Future Steps: Advanced Features**
- Consider training a custom YOLO model with your own dataset if necessary.
- Develop an alert system for abnormal events (e.g., too many vehicles).
- Implement remote access and monitoring to check results from anywhere.
